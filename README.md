### Projects
NBA Stats Analysis Project (Python, pandas, NumPy, sklearn, seaborn)
- Analyzed and manipulated multiple datasets with over 8,500 rows of NBA player stats using Python, pandas, and NumPy
- Employed data cleaning techniques, mathematical adjustments, and DataFrame concatenation to categorize NBA players' career outcomes season by season
- Developed a predictive model using logistic regression and sklearn for forecasting player career outcomes, supported by data analysis and visualization tools like seaborn
Image Processing App (Python)
- Coded the ability to negate, grayscale, rotate 180Â°, replace the background image, replace specific color, and add a sticker overlay to an inputted RGB Image
- Implemented a K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning classifier to predict a label for a given RGB image
Digit Classifier Program (Java)
- Designed and developed an image recognition system for hand-drawn digits
- Utilized a d-ary heap, priority queue, interfaces, and KNN classifier
Celebrity Search Engine (Java)
- Allocated a Binary Search Tree (BST) and used it to create a basic search engine
- Read a file containing movie data, populate BSTs based on keywords, and perform queries to find related movies, actors, and movie studios
